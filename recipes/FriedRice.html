    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Tip the rice into a medium saucepan. Add 300ml/10fl oz water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat, cover with a lid and simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat, drain off any excess water and leave to steam dry, uncovered in the pan until ready to use.</li>
        <li>Heat a tablespoon of the oil in a frying pan or wok over a medium heat. Add the eggs and cook, stirring, until scrambled. Transfer to a plate and return the pan to the heat.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the pan over a high heat. Add the onion and pepper, then season with salt and pepper. Fry for 2 minutes, then add the garlic and ginger, if using, and fry for a further minute.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium, add the cooked rice, spring onions, peas, if using, scrambled egg and soy sauce. Toss together and cook for 3~5 minutes, or until heated through.</li>
